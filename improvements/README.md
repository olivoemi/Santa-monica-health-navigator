# Santa Monica Health Navigator - Improvements

This directory contains all the improvements made to the Santa Monica Health Navigator website (https://thick-buses-argue.lindy.site/).

## ðŸŽ¯ Problems Solved

### 1. Smart Category System (`smart-category-system.js`)
**Problem:** When users selected "Head" body part and clicked "Headache", the category dropdown would default to "General" and show irrelevant options like "Gynecological".

**Solution:** 
- Auto-selects "Neurological" for headaches
- Hides irrelevant categories based on body part
- Maps 40+ symptoms to appropriate medical specialties
- Filters dropdown options intelligently

### 2. Simplified Insurance Form (`simplified-insurance-form.js`)
**Problem:** Insurance form was too complex with Member ID, Copay Amount, Deductible questions that confused users.

**Solution:**
- Hides complex optional fields
- Adds helpful guidance text
- Simplifies to 2-3 essential questions
- Makes form more user-friendly

### 3. Provider Websites (`provider-websites.js`)
**Problem:** Recommended care providers didn't include website links for users to get more information.

**Solution:**
- Adds "Visit Website" buttons to provider recommendations
- Includes 20+ major Santa Monica area providers
- Links open in new tabs
- Works with dynamic content loading
